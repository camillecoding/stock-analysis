# stock-analysis

# Overview of Project
In this VBA Analysis, the client wanted me to program stock analysis on several companies. The data, pulled from 2017 and 2018, confirmed the open and closing prices of each stock, as well as the high, low, and total daily volume. With this information, I used VBA to program a response to tell the user about stock performance over time.

# Results

Since I already completed a similar VBA project, I had to refactor my code to achieve a new goal for my client. Although I was able to reuse much of my code, the new goal required a lot of debugging to ensure that the task was performed accurately.
