# stock-analysis

# Overview of Project
In this VBA Analysis, the client wanted me to program stock analysis on several companies. The data, pulled from 2017 and 2018, confirmed the open and closing prices of each stock, as well as the high, low, and total daily volume. With this information, I used VBA to program a response to tell the user about stock performance over time.

# Results

Since I already completed a similar VBA project, I had to refactor my code to achieve a new goal for my client. Although I was able to reuse much of my code, the new goal required a lot of debugging to ensure that the task was performed accurately.

The key to refactoring my original code was to focus on increasing the right inputs. Based on my code, the section below was key to make accurate.

# Summary

This project was largely concerned with refactoring code. Throughout this project, I have learned some distinct advantages and disadvantages to working with original code. One of the main advantages was having a functioning blueprint to work from. Since the original code was already debugged and running effectively, I measured my refactored code against it frequently to catch any errors. One of the primary disadvantages was that the code became more lengthy than necessary. It's highly probable that my refactored code was not as simply written as it could have been. However, whether working with an original code or writing new code myself, debugging is a major part of any project. 

After working on this project, I have a distinct preference for writing original code in VBA script over working on or with refactored code. Overall, I think VBA is less user-friendly than other programs. Debugging code is far more cumbersome here than in Python or Javascript. VBA will indicate errors within your code, but these notifications are not detailed enough to provide deeper insight into why your code cannot run as is. I would much prefer to develop my expertise in another program rather than continue to work in VBA.
